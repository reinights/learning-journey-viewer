## Description

Initially, I created the layout that is sufficient for this type of UI. In my mind, I was assuming that this is something that managers might assign to employers, requiring completion.

Thus, the design and layout is represented as "tickets" that the user needs to complete, with colour coding to mentally seperate the complete and in progress lessons.

For development, my approach was straight forward. I initially worked on filtering the dataset using the select tag, and mapping them out with a skeleton UI. Afterwards, I then focused on styling where my mind immediately went to using grid displays as it is perfect for managing layouts for contents dynamically.

The HTML for the select tag was generated by AI as this was an unusual tag for me.

With more time, based on my own assumptions on what this UI is for, I'd love to add an overview that lets its users quickly view a summarised version of their performance. This can be based on time, or general percentages.
